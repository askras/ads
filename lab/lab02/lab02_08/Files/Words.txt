How do people treat animals? 
Unfortunately, many people are often indifferent or even, in some cases, aggressive and hostile toward animals. 
However, man is only a part of nature, not its master, which is why it is so important to appreciate and protect all living creatures around us. 
The text of V.G. Korolenko raises the problem of the attitude of people to "our little brothers".
So, the writer tells of a "strange" man, whose outstanding, remarkable feature was a special love for animals. 
Ignatovich never neglected either "a frozen crow" or "a sick horse," trying to help everyone who needed it. 
This man loved animals much more than people: "He not only recognized in them the mind, memory, intellect, conscience, but even considered these aspects of intellect exclusively their belonging, completely alien to man. 
Initially, it seems that Ignatovich is a real misanthrope, capable of sympathizing only with animals. 
However, it is difficult to imagine a callous and cold-blooded person who would love "our lesser brethren" so much. 
Behind the "unbearable" wit and mockery really hid a kind, pure heart.
To convince us of the exceptional mercy of the hero we are helped by the following episode: the coachman was about to pass two dying ducks, and Ignatovich demanded to stop. 
These birds were exhausted by "illness" and "lack of strength for the flight," and the hero of V.G. Korolenko could not leave them alone. 
Ignatovich was deeply moved by the behavior of the duck, who returned to his friend, who had lost the ability to fly: "I cannot describe to you the effect that this show of generosity had on my friend. 
We see how the hero is reverent toward animals, almost humanizing them and caring for them because he cannot remain indifferent to their suffering.
Both arguments are interrelated and complement each other, creating a complete image of the hero and revealing the author's idea of the importance of caring for "our little brothers". 
Unlike the coachman, Ignatovich does not allow himself to abandon the dying ducks in trouble.
The result of the writer's reflections becomes the following position: people treat animals differently. 
Some show love and tenderness, while others are indifferent to them, and sometimes such an attitude borders on cruelty.
One cannot but agree with the author's point of view. 
Indeed, not everyone is willing to help "our little brothers. 
Consider, for example, the story by LM Andreev "Cusaka," the heroes of which abandoned the dog to its fate. 
They first tame Kusaka, and then left alone, as if it were not a living creature, but only an unnecessary thing.
Thus, it is important to cultivate an effective love for animals, which manifests itself in constant care and desire to help in a difficult moment
